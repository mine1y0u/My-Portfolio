## 🧩 Mini Projects

### 📍 [**C# Windows Forms: Text Encryptor/Decryptor**](https://github.com/mine1y0u/My-Portfolio/tree/main/mini-projects/1.%20Text%20Encryptor%20%26%20Decryptor)


<p align="justify">This is a project created using Visual Studio 2022 — a simple Windows Forms application developed in C# that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages based on a basic custom mathematical formula they input. The app replaces characters using custom logic involving variables <b>CN</b> (character number), <b>X</b> (key), and <b>T</b> (alphabet length). </p>

### 📍 [**Grade Computation Using Java** *(Collaborative Work)*](https://github.com/mine1y0u/My-Portfolio/tree/main/mini-projects/2.%20Grade%20Computation)

<p align="justify">A collaborative project built using <b>Java</b> programming language that computes student grades. It includes calculations for the First Semester, Second Semester, and Overall Average. I contributed to the concept, layout, and implementation of the code.</p>

### 📍 [**Number System Converter Using C++**](https://github.com/mine1y0u/My-Portfolio/tree/main/mini-projects/3.%20Number%20System%20Converter)

<p align="justify">This is a project that was developed using the <b>C++</b> programming language and featuring a console-based interface. It is a simple Number System Converter program that takes user-inputted number in one base — <b>Decimal (Base 10)</b>, <b>Binary (Base 2)</b>, <b>Octal (Base 8)</b>, or <b>Hexadecimal (Base 16)</b> — and converts it to the user's desired format.</p>

### 📍 [**Number System Calculator Using C++**](https://github.com/mine1y0u/My-Portfolio/tree/main/mini-projects/4.%20Number%20System%20Calculator)

 <p align="justify"> This project was developed using the <b>C++</b> programming language and features a console-based interface. It is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations — <b>addition</b> and <b>subtraction</b> — between two numbers provided by the user in different number systems: <b>Decimal</b>, <b>Octal</b>, or <b>Hexadecimal</b>. The result is then displayed either in Decimal, Octal, or Hexadecimal, depending on the base of the second number.</p>
