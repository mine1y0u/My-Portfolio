<h1 align="center"><b>🌟 E-Service Citizen Portal 🌟</b> <br> <i>(Collaborative Work)</i></h1>

### 💫 Intro
<p align="justify">A collaborative project for both <b>Web Development</b> and <b>Human Computer Interaction</b> courses. It was built using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b>, and <b>MySQL</b> for the database, and designed in <b>Figma</b> for mockups and UI planning. This project is a website made for a local municipality or community, offering service request forms and a status tracker for submitted requests.</p>

## 📖 Project Overview
<p align="justify">The <b>E-Service Citizen Portal</b> is a municipality focused website designed and developed to handle online services, such as permits, complaints, and request forms. The portal allows residents to fill out digital forms and monitor the status of their submissions in real time.</p>

<p align="justify">This is a team project for both Web Development and Human Computer Interaction courses. It focused on usability and accessibility, aiming to create an intuitive interface that could be easily navigated by the citizens — especially those who are not very familiar with technology, such as the elders.</p>

## 📌 Notes
> This is a course project made for academic purposes under the Web Development and Human Computer Interaction course. 

> This is our second project with the use of the tool Figma. I already had the basic knowledge of the tool, which helped me understand its features better, though I still need to practice more to improve even better.
