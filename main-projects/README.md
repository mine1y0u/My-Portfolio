## 🚀 Main Projects

### 📍[**LearnifyHub — Innovative Interactive Product** *(Collaborative Work)*](https://github.com/mine1y0u/My-Portfolio/tree/main/main-projects/1.%20LearnifyHub)

<p align="justify">A collaborative project from my <b>Human Computer Interaction</b> course, created using <b>Figma</b>. I designed the selected theme, layout, and UI for our interactive product named <b><i>"LearnifyHub"</i></b>. It is an interactive mobile application designed as a one-stop-shop platform for various study enrichment tools. While each member was tasked to create their own design proposal, the one I made was chosen and used as the final product. The Double Diamond Design Process was applied throughout the project.</p>
