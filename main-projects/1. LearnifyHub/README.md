<h1 align="center"><b>🌟 LearnifyHub — Innovative Interactive Product 🌟</b> <br> <i>(Collaborative Work)</i></h1>

### 💫 Intro
<p align="justify">A collaborative project from my <b>Human Computer Interaction</b> course, created using <b>Figma</b>. I designed the selected theme, layout, and UI for our interactive product named <b><i>"LearnifyHub"</i></b>. It is an interactive mobile application designed as a one-stop-shop platform for various study enrichment tools. While each member was tasked to create their own design proposal, the one I made was chosen and used as the final product. The Double Diamond Design Process was applied throughout the project.</p>

## 📖 Project Making Overview
<p align="justify">This was our first ever project that focused on UI/UX design based on the app concept that my team discussed. It was also my first time using Figma to design a mobile application. During the process, I learned a lot about visual consistency, user-centered design process, prototyping, overall importance of designing, and other more through the experience.</p>

## 📱 About the App
<p align="justify">
<b>LearnifyHub</b> is an interactive platform that is designed to be an easy to use mobile application with the goal of making a study app that is a one-stop-shop for all the study enrichment tools — such as videos, articles, eBooks, pdfs, and more – that a user could ever need to enhance the learners study experience.</p>
<p align="justify">The app concept is dedicated in ensuring its motivating learning environment and emphasizes usability and accessibility. Key features of the app includes:</p>

- 🏆 A motivational "Level Up" and "Streak" ahievement system with badges, titles, and trophies
- 🧩 Smart filters (by educational level, material type, date, language, rating, etc) for quick access to relevant materials
- 📚 A wide variety of study resources — vidoes, eBooks, PDFs, e-courses, articles, and more
- 🧭 Easy navigation by a quick-access menu
- 📚 Customizable personal libraries for organizing saved resources

<p align="justify">LearnifyHub focuses on providing learners with a diverse study tools catered to their needs, paired with a gamified "Level Up" achievement-based motivational model that rewards users for their growth and encourages continuous learning.</p>
